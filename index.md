Have cool webapp ideas but not the resources to deploy them? As a resident of Next House, you can get free server space!

### What this is for

As an MIT student, you already have access to your [Athena locker](http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3907090) where you can keep static webpages. You also have access to [scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu), which lets you do a bit more than plain Athena, like Python/php CGI scripts. However, if you want to host something like a node app, Flask app, or anything not supported by scripts, you'd be out of luck. But now, you can use the Next House server for whatever you want!
